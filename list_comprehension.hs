-- We'll stick to getting the first 10 even numbers for now. The list comprehension we could use is [x*2 | x <- [1..10]]. x is drawn from [1..10] and for every element in [1..10] (which we have bound to x), we get that element, only doubled. Here's that comprehension in action.

[x*2 | x <- [1..10]] -- [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]

-- with predicates
-- Let's say we want only the elements which, doubled, are greater than or equal to 12.
[x*2 | x <- [1..10], x*2 >= 12]  -- [12,14,16,18,20]

-- How about if we wanted all numbers from 50 to 100 whose remainder when divided with the number 7 is 3?
[ x | x <- [50..100], x `mod` 7 == 3] -- [52,59,66,73,80,87,94]

--  Let's say we want a comprehension that replaces each odd number greater than 10 with "BANG!" and each odd number that's less than 10 with "BOOM!". If a number isn't odd, we throw it out of our list. For convenience, we'll put that comprehension inside a function so we can easily reuse it.
boomBangs xs = [ if x < 10 then "BOOM!" else "BANG!" | x <- xs, odd x]


-- We can include several predicates. If we wanted all numbers from 10 to 20 that are not 13, 15 or 19, we'd do:
[ x | x <- [10..20], x /= 13, x /= 15, x /= 19] -- [10,11,12,14,16,17,18,20] 

-- If we have two lists, [2,5,10] and [8,10,11] and we want to get the products of all the possible combinations between numbers in those lists, here's what we'd do.
[ x*y | x <- [2,5,10], y <- [8,10,11]]  -- [16,20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110]

-- As expected, the length of the new list is 9. What if we wanted all possible products that are more than 50?
[ x*y | x <- [2,5,10], y <- [8,10,11], x*y > 50]  --[55,80,100,110]

-- How about a list comprehension that combines a list of adjectives and a list of nouns â€¦ for epic hilarity.
let nouns = ["hobo","frog","pope"]
let adjectives = ["lazy","grouchy","scheming"]
[adjective ++ " " ++ noun | adjective <- adjectives, noun <- nouns] --["lazy hobo","lazy frog","lazy pope","grouchy hobo","grouchy frog",  "grouchy pope","scheming hobo","scheming frog","scheming pope"]

--I know! Let's write our own version of length! We'll call it length'.
length' xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs] 
-- _ means that we don't care what we'll draw from the list anyway so instead of writing a variable name that we'll never use, we just write _.

-- Here's a function that takes a string and removes everything except uppercase letters from it.
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c <- st, c `elem` ['A'..'Z']]
